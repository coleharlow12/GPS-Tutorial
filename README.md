# GPS-Tutorial

## Description
This code is part of a tutorial meant to be used with the Adafruit ultimate GPS breakout board. It is a very simple code which reads the GPS data from the Adafruit GPS and then prints it to through the Arduino Serial port. If the Arduino is connected to a computer running Arduino IDE then the contents of the GPS messages can be viewed using the Arduino Terminal and setting the baud rate to 57600. 

## What You Will Need
 - Arduino IDE 
 - An Arduino UNO (other boards will work just done use AltSoftSerial if using a board with multiple Serial Ports).
 - [AltSoftSerial](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial).
 - [NeoGPS](https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS).
